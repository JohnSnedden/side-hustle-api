# Square Toast - API

This repo project is an API and database for a simple Point of Sale (POS) system. A second repo exists for a corresponding web client

## Background

This is my second project as part of the General Assembly Web Development Immersive program.

We were given the freedom to choose what to develop.

I chose to develop a lightweight quoting tool for freelance workers to quote potential customers.

# Deployed sites
The app and api are currently deployed here:

api https://side-hustle.herokuapp.com/ 
app https://johnsnedden.github.io/side-hustle/

## Unsolved Problems
From an API perspective I'd like to incorportae more controls around data creation. Making sure that records can not be linked to non-owned resources.

## Future Development
There is a lot of scope for building out this product. Projects and Estimates need to be added, then there is always the option of tracking the time worked on the projects. That could also open the possibility to billing.
